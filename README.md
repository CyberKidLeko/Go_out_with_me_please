The application uses Oracle Database to store the selected date options. To configure your database:

Make sure the oracledb module is installed in your Node.js environment.
Update your database credentials in the server.js file.
Ensure the database is running locally or on a server that the application can access.
Note: The database files are not included in this repository. You will need to set up the database independently.
